# Tools

This folder contains helper scripts that support project management or setup,
but are **not part of the core `src/` package code**.

- `create_issues_from_csv.py`: one-off script used to bulk-create GitHub Issues
  for the 8-week Python Sprint from a CSV file.

These scripts are optional and only exist to document the workflow.
